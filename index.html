      <p><img src="assets/images/MainPhoto.gif" class="img-circle" alt="MainPhoto"></p>
      <p>I have a fur child that runs my life, her name is Lulu. I may not have children, but I probably spend enough money, time, and even have sitter to have her included as such. You might call me dog crazy! One has to be a little crazy to own a Jack Russell because they are nothing but energy and stubborness. </p>
      <p>Other than my obsession for my dog I love to be outside and enjoying the beautiful weather that we have here in San Diego. Nothing peaks my interest more than the thrill of an adventure. There is limitless fun to be had, anything from scuba diving to mountain biking. </p>
      <p>My job history is extremely varied. I've done super fun jobs, like working at a halloween store! I mean, who doesn't like getting to dress up every day for work? To the other end of the spectrum of being on a drilling for for 14-21 days straight. Life is what you make of it, don't let time pass you by.</p>
